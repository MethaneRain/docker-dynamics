## Atmospheric Dynamics Lab - Python Edition!

The object of this multi-week lab are to understand not only the code (even if python and coding are new to you, don't sweat) but also the equations behind the Geostrophic Wind and subsequent quantities.

** The lab will be run <em>in class</em>, so please do your best to be in class on lab days! **


The basic outline will be as follows:
<ul>
    <li> Day 1: Get to know Python, just give it a chance...
    </li>
    <li> Day 2: Work on figuring out Python syntax ans functions for dynamics - Geostrophic Winds at 500mb
    </li>
    <li> Day 3: Work on Plotting - Geostrophic Winds at 500mb  
    </li>
    <li> Day 4: Work on Absolute Vorticity syntax and functions
    </li>
</ul>
